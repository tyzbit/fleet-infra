## The purpose of snapshots and backups are to be able to restore data to the last known good state
## either due to full data loss or corruption/unwanted data change
## Data properties:
## -  Can change slowly or quickly.
##      If the data changes quickly, we must snapshot/backup more frequently. We must also retain more.
##      If the data changes slowly, we can snapshot less frequently
## -  Is low priority or high priority.
##      Low priority means we don't need offsite backups
##      Medium priority means we need an offsite backup
##      High priority means we need multiple copies of offsite backups
## -  Is of low criticality or high criticality
##      Low criticality means the latest snapshot can be a backup, which takes longer to restore
##      High criticality means the latest snapshot should be a snapshot
## 
## Concurrency can be the same reasonable setting for all backups
## When a backup is taken, it also takes a snapshot
##
## With these considerations, the following groups will exist
## SlowLowPriorityLowCriticality             | Snapshot every day, retain 2          | Backup never
## SlowLowPriorityHighCriticality            | Snapshot every day, retain 2          | Backup never
## SlowMediumPriorityLowCriticality          |                                       | Backup every day, retain 1
## SlowMediumPriorityHighCriticality         | Snapshot every 6 hour, retain 4       | Backup every day, retain 1
## SlowHighPriorityLowCriticality            |                                       | Backup every day, retain 7
## SlowHighPriorityHighCriticality           | Snapshot every 6 hour, retain 4       | Backup every day, retain 7
## FastLowPriorityLowCriticality             | Snapshot every hour, retain 6         | Backup never
## FastLowPriorityHighCriticality            | Snapshot every hour, retain 6         | Backup never
## FastMediumPriorityLowCriticality          |                                       | Backup every 2 hours, retain 1
## FastMediumPriorityHighCriticality         | Snapshot every hour, retain 6         | Backup every 2 hours, retain 1
## FastHighPriorityLowCriticality            |                                       | Backup every hour, retain 6
## FastHighPriorityHighCriticality           | Snapshot every 10 minutes, retain 6   | Backup every hour, retain 6
##
## Finally, we need to translate this to unique RecurringJobs.
## Recurring jobs are either snapshot or backup
